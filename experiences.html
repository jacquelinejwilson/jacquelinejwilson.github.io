<p><strong>Hello there and welcome to my personal webpage, created by yours truly!</strong>
    
<p>My name is Jacqueline Wilson and I am a 22-year-old Telecommunication: Media and Society Senior attending the University of Florida.</p> 
    
<p>My loving parents brought me into this world on March 7, 1991 in Miami, Florida. Growing up as the middle child of three daughters I was just your typical Florida girl, spending my days outside doing anything and everything you could imagine under the hot Miami sun.

As much as my heart belongs to my hometown, my real passion in life is traveling. I have actually been to over 20 different countries with my favorites being Sweden and Russia. In my free time I enjoy perusing the Internet for fashion/style/design websites, obsessing over the Harry Potter series, as well as taking my beloved mutt Charlie to the dog park.  

<p>After completing high school I attended Florida International University from 2009-2011 with an undeclared major. I was focused on transferring to my parents and many other family member’s alma mater, the University of Florida which is what I did in the Fall of 2011. I absolutely love the educational and social aspects of the university as well as the beautiful campus and of course, our football team! GO GATORS!

<p>My major is now Telecommunications with a focus in Media and Society. During the summer of 2013 I completed an internship with The Independent Florida Alligator where I worked with the advertising department. I plan on completing my bachelors degree in the spring of 2014 and from then on out the future is wide open for me! I would love to travel a little more before beginning either a career or graduate school. In a perfect world I would love to eventually work in the new media field in Miami.
