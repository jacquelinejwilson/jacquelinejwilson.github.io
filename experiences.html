<p><strong>Hello there and welcome to my personal webpage, created by yours truly!</strong>
    
<p>My name is Jacqueline Wilson and I am a 22-year-old Telecommunication: Media and Society Senior attending the University of Florida.</p> 
    
<p>My parents brought me into this world on March 7, 1991 in Miami, Florida. Growing up as the middle child of three daughters I was your typical Florida girl, spending my days under the hot Miami sun.

As much as my heart belongs to my hometown, my real passion in life is traveling. I have been to many destinations across the globe, with my favorites being Sweden, Spain and Russia. In my free time I enjoy exploring my city, perusing the Internet for fashion and design websites and spending time with friends.   </p>    

<p>After completing high school I attended Florida International University from 2009-2011 with an undeclared major. I was focused on transferring to my parents and many other family member’s alma mater, the University of Florida which is what I did in the Fall of 2011. I absolutely love the educational and social aspects of the university as well as the beautiful campus and of course, our football team! GO GATORS!

<p>My major is now Telecommunications with a focus in Media and Society. During the summer of 2013 I completed an internship with The Independent Florida Alligator where I worked with the advertising department. I plan on completing my bachelors degree in the spring of 2014 and from then on out the future is wide open for me! I would love to travel a little more before beginning either a career or graduate school. In a perfect world I would love to eventually work in the new media field in South Florida.
